# Entropy
Compiler for Entropy, a programming language where all data is in a constant state of decay. Entropy forces the programmer to give up on precise control, and get an idea across in the short time before their program falls apart. 

The compiler takes these options:

    /h or /? -- print help screen
    /m -- set mutation rate (speed that data decays), must be between 0.001 and 100
    /d -- Debug mode: parse tree and print to screen
    /c -- Transpile to C#
